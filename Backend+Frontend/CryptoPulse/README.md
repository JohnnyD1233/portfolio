# CryptoLive

CryptoLive is a real-time cryptocurrency price tracker that displays live price updates for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and Frapped USDT (FUSDT). The project fetches the latest prices from an API and dynamically updates the prices on the webpage with indicators to show whether the price has gone up or down.

## Features

- **Real-time Updates**: Prices are updated every 3 seconds for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
- **Price Indicators**: Green and red arrows indicate price increases and decreases, respectively.
- **Multiple Cryptocurrencies**: Displays the prices for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and Frapped USDT (FUSDT).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **API**: Fetches cryptocurrency price data from a public API (configure the API URL and token in the source code).
- **Libraries**: Uses native JavaScript (fetch, DOM manipulation) for API calls and updating the UI.
